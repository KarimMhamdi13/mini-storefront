1. I generally ask Copilot to form some inital code to get me started and especially to troubleshoot, like when attempting to npm run dev gives me an error, I relay the error to copilot and attempt to work out what went wrong and how I could fix it. I alos use the auto-fill in feature when typing code, mostly when the next step is obvious or doing repetetive list-filling.
2. Copilot wanted the chart to be a line-chart that showed the history of sold objects, but not only was this chart not dynamic (since while I can put items in the chart I can't "buy" them), it also showed dummy data to represent previous month's sale history. Upon realizing this I started on the current chart, which is dynamic and doesn't use dummy data.
3. Troubleshooting. I'm not the best and figuring out what's wrong when there isn't red underlines or clear error messages. Like when I managed tp get the program to run but the chart wasn't functioning- it just stayed at its default state. Through troubleshooting with Copilot I was able to figure out the issue and resolve it, which would've been much mire difficult if I was trying stuff on my own without a good idea of where to start.
